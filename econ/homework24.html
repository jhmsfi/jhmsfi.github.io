<nl>

A society changes a pre-existing norm.  Without references to previous models:

<li> Model, using whatever techniques you wish, the above scenario.
<p>
<ul>
   <li> Explicitly state your model and key assumptions.
   <li> Summarize key results.
   <li> Suggest some potentially interesting future directions and
questions for the model.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Suggest at least one "easy" norm transition that your model could capture.
<li> Suggest at least one "hard" norm transition that your model could capture.
