    </font>Electronic version of<i> Experiments with Economic
                Principles </i>(co-authored by Marcus Giametti,
              Humberto Llavador, John Miller, and Ted Bergstrom) <br>
            </h3>
            <p>Most of the experiments in out text can now be run
              without paper.&nbsp; Professrors Giametti and Llavador
              have written slick software that runs on students' cell
              phones or laptops, which tell them their experimental
              roles and where they can <br>
              enter their contracts after agreeing to a sale.&nbsp; They
              have also adopted the&nbsp; experimental
              instructions,&nbsp; warm-up exercises, homework, and some
              discussion for web access.&nbsp; The software records
              transaction prices and creates&nbsp; spreadsheets showing
              the&nbsp; results of the experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<font
