Learning Basic Economics
</B>
</FONT>

<FONT FACE="geneva, arial, helvetica, sans-serif" Size=-1>

<P>
The basic principles of economics provide an incredibly powerful
framework for understanding and changing the world.  Alas, it is hard to imagine
a worse way to try and teach/learn these ideas than by using the standard
lecture format and fat books that have become the norm.  

<P>
Over the last decade, colleagues and I have been developing a wonderful
alternative for teaching economics.  The approach, based on classroom
experiments, actively engages students in experiencing, discovering, and 
understanding the key ideas underlying economics.  Studies indicate that students
learn as much or more using such methods, while enjoying the
experience far more than usual.

<P>
Ted Bergstrom and I have a textbook, <A HREF="eep/index.html">
Experiments with Economic Principles, 2nd ed</A> (McGraw Hill), that
fully embraces the experimental approach to teaching economic principles.

<P>
As my colleague Murray Gell-Mann points out, it is remarkable how little
education has changed over the last few centuries (five hundred years ago,
monks in a scriptorium used to dutifully 
sit and copy every word that was read to them by a lector from a 
manuscript...and now...).  
The web offers some new, and potentially powerful, learning opportunities, and
both the EconU and <A HREF="http://www.econx.com">EconX</A> projects are designed to exploit these opportunities while
also making quality education available to a much larger audience.

<P>
Based on the <A HREF="#learnbasic">active learning ideas discussed above</A>, we
have developed a fully automated, web-based version of an experiment-based course
in economic principles (a link will be posted soon).  Students
participate over the web in a series of experiments (students need only to have access
to a standard web browser, and the experiments can easily be given outside of 
normal class time).  After each experiment, the student completes a customized 
workbook/textbook that is seamlessly tied to his or her recent experimental experience.
The system handles all of the routine class management tasks (including grading the
workbooks), allowing the students to devote more time to learning while the instructor
devotes more time to teaching.

<P>
The on-line course was initially
developed by <A HREF="bmind/bmind.html">Beginner's Mind</A>, 
a company I founded for creating
information systems designed to facilitate learning by immersing students in 
active learning experiences.  The goal here is to revolutionize the way 
education is delivered by providing fully integrated learning solutions for 
both students and teachers. 
A generous grant from the Hewlett Foundation has
allowed further development of the system under the auspices of Carnegie
Mellon's 
<A HREF="http://www.cmu.edu/oli/">Open Learning Initiative (OLI)</A>.

<P>
Scott Page (Michigan) and I have been running the 
<CITE>Graduate Workshop in Computational Social Science Modeling and Complexity</CITE>
since 1995.  The two-week workshop, sponsored by the Santa Fe Institute, takes place each
summer usually in July.  The workshop brings together a small group of top graduate students 
from around the world for a series of lectures and a very intensive period of
scientific collaboration on projects of their choosing.  The workshop creates, if
only for a short time, a nice model of what graduate education should be about---pursuing
frontier science in a wonderfully collaborative and enjoyable environment.

<P>
Descriptions of past workshops and the announcement for the next workshop can be
found <a href="../econ/">here</a>.

<A href="teaching/syll110.html">73/88-110 Experiments with Economic Principles</A>:
This course, usually taught each fall at CMU,
teaches the key principles of economics through the use of classroom
experiments.  Students learn about each principle by first participating in
an experiment where they attempt to earn profit by, say, trading used
cars (hopefully, watching out for lemons!).  After each experiment the relevant
economic theory is developed and tested against the behavior observed in the
class.  As mentioned <A HREF="#learnbasic">above</A>, this is a great way to learn the principles
of economics (and, fortunately, formal student ratings reflect this observation as well).

<P><A href="teaching/syll220.html">88-220 Policy Analysis I</A>:  Variants of this
course are currently being taught at CMU each fall by 
by Roberto Weber.  The course
is focused around the ideas that emerge in intermediate micro economics.  As above,
the course uses experiments to facilitate the learning of these concepts.

<P>
A group of ex-Navy divers provided my first formal training in teaching when I became a SCUBA instructor in 1978.  Those lessons, along with countless others from a fine group of professors
throughout my academic career, have always made teaching an enjoyable and productive experience for me and,
hopefully, my students.
<P>
Over the past few years, I have collected some
